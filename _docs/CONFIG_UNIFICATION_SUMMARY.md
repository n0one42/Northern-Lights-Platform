# Configuration Files Unification Summary

## Overview

All four configuration files have been successfully unified to follow best
practices and eliminate conflicts between tools. The configurations now work
harmoniously with consistent standards across the project.

## Key Changes Applied

### 1. **Line Length Standardization**

- **Unified to 120 characters** across all tools
- `.editorconfig`: Added `max_line_length = 120` for all file types
- `.prettierrc.json`: Changed from 160 to 120
- `ansible/.yamllint`: Kept at 120 (was already correct)
- `ansible/.ansible-lint`: Removed unsupported `max_line_length` property
  (delegated to yamllint)

### 2. **Bracket/Brace Spacing**

- **Unified bracket spacing to `true`** for consistency
- `.prettierrc.json`: Changed YAML files from `bracketSpacing: false` to `true`
- `ansible/.yamllint`: Kept braces with spaces (`min-spaces-inside: 1`)
- This ensures `{ key: value }` format everywhere with spaces

### 3. **Document Start Markers**

- **Standardized to require `---`** for all Ansible YAML files
- `ansible/.yamllint`: Changed from `present: false` to `present: true`
- This follows Ansible best practices for clear file boundaries

### 4. **Indentation Standards**

- **YAML/JSON**: 2 spaces (consistent across all tools)
- **Python**: 4 spaces (PEP 8 standard)
- **Makefiles**: Tabs (required by Make)
- **Shell scripts**: 2 spaces

### 5. **Quote Handling**

- **YAML**: Minimal quoting (only when necessary)
- **JSON**: Double quotes (JSON standard)
- **Prettier**: Configured to preserve minimal quoting for YAML

## Detailed Changes by File

### `.editorconfig`

```ini
# Added:
- max_line_length = 120 for consistency
- Specific sections for shell scripts
- Makefile support with tabs
- Separated YAML and JSON configurations
```

### `.prettierrc.json`

```json
# Changed:
- printWidth: 160 → 120
- bracketSpacing for YAML: false → true
- Added explicit YAML parser specification
- Added specific handling for Ansible files
- Fixed deprecated jsxBracketSameLine → bracketSameLine
```

### `ansible/.yamllint`

```yaml
# Added:
- document-start: present: true (require ---)
- Formatting rules for colons, commas, hyphens
- Key duplicate detection
- Empty values rules
- Additional ignore paths (.cache/, molecule/)
```

### `ansible/.ansible-lint`

```yaml
# Added:
- Enhanced file type detection for .yaml files
- Mock roles for testing
- Additional mock modules
- Removed unsupported properties (max_line_length, collections_list)
- Added documentation comments for removed features
```

## Tool Processing Order

1. **EditorConfig** - Base formatting rules (runs in IDE)
2. **Prettier** - Code formatting (pre-commit)
3. **Yamllint** - YAML validation (pre-commit)
4. **Ansible-lint** - Ansible best practices (pre-commit)

## Validation Commands

Run these commands to verify the unified configuration:

```bash
# Check if configs are valid
yamllint ansible/.yamllint
ansible-lint --version

# Test the configurations
cd ansible/
yamllint .
ansible-lint

# Format check with Prettier
npx prettier --check "**/*.{yml,yaml,json,md}"

# Apply formatting if needed
npx prettier --write "**/*.{yml,yaml,json,md}"
```

## Benefits of Unification

1. **No More Conflicts**: All tools agree on formatting standards
2. **CI/CD Ready**: Consistent checks across development and pipelines
3. **Developer Experience**: Clear, unified standards reduce confusion
4. **Best Practices**: Follows industry standards for each tool
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and maintain configurations

## Migration Guide

After applying these changes:

1. **Reformat existing files**:

   ```bash
   npx prettier --write .
   ```

2. **Fix Ansible linting issues**:

   ```bash
   cd ansible/
   ansible-lint --fix
   ```

3. **Verify YAML files**:

   ```bash
   yamllint ansible/
   ```

4. **Commit the changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: Unify configuration files and resolve conflicts"
   ```

## Important Notes

- **Line Length**: All tools now respect 120 character limit
- **YAML Files**: Must start with `---` for Ansible files
- **Bracket Spacing**: Consistent `{ key: value }` format
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces for YAML/JSON, 4 for Python
- **Ansible-lint**: Some properties like `max_line_length` and
  `collections_list` are not supported and have been removed

## Summary

The configuration files are now fully unified and follow best practices. The
main conflicts resolved were:

- Line length inconsistency (160 vs 120)
- Bracket spacing conflicts in YAML
- Document start marker requirements
- Deprecated Prettier options

All future code will follow these unified standards automatically through IDE
integration and pre-commit hooks.
