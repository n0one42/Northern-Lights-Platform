# SSH + Sudo + YubiKey vs Proxmox API + API Token

That is a superb, high-level security question. You have correctly identified the fundamental trade-off. It's a classic case of **Authentication Strength** vs. **Authorization Scope (Least Privilege)**.

Let's break this down carefully. This is a crucial concept.

Your old way was **SSH + Sudo + YubiKey**. The new way is **Proxmox API + API Token**.

Here is a direct comparison of the security posture of each method:

| Security Principle | SSH + Sudo + YubiKey (Old Way) | Proxmox API Token (New Way) | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication Strength** | **Extremely High.** Requires possession of the private key AND a physical touch of the YubiKey. Protects against theft of the private key file. | **Moderate.** Requires possession of the token secret. A long, random string, but it's a single factor. If stolen, it can be used. | **Old Way** |
| **Principle of Least Privilege** | **Extremely Poor.** You are giving Ansible `root` access to the entire Proxmox hypervisor. A compromised Ansible run could reconfigure networking, delete storage pools, install malware, or destroy other VMs not in the inventory. | **Excellent.** You create a dedicated role (e.g., `AnsibleProvisioner`) that ONLY has permissions to `VM.Allocate`, `VM.Config.*`, `VM.PowerMgmt`, etc. It has **zero** ability to alter the underlying host OS. | **New Way** |
| **Audit Trail** | **Poor.** The Proxmox logs will show that the user `root` performed actions. It's impossible to distinguish between an action taken by your Ansible automation and an action taken by you logged in as `root`. | **Excellent.** The Proxmox audit log will show that the user `ansible@pve` via the token `ansible` performed a specific, discrete API action. The source is unambiguous. | **New Way** |
| **Attack Surface** | **Larger.** Exposes the SSH daemon to your Ansible controller. Requires a real login user on the hypervisor with sudo privileges. | **Smaller.** Exposes only the Proxmox web API (port 8006). The API user (`ansible@pve`) doesn't even need a valid shell, making it useless if an attacker somehow got onto the box. | **New Way** |
| **Revocation Speed** | **Slow/Difficult.** If your private key is compromised, you must manually log in to the hypervisor and remove the key from `authorized_keys`. | **Instant.** Go to the Proxmox UI, find the API token, and click "Revoke". Access is immediately terminated for that token, with no effect on other tokens or users. | **New Way** |

## **The Verdict**

You are correct that the *act of authenticating* with your YubiKey is more secure than just using a token.

However, the **API token method is overwhelmingly more secure for the system as a whole.**

Think of it in terms of "blast radius."

* **SSH/YubiKey Compromise Scenario:** An attacker somehow compromises your Ansible controller and your YubiKey. The blast radius is **your entire Proxmox host**. They have `root`. They can destroy everything and cover their tracks.
* **API Token Compromise Scenario:** An attacker compromises your Ansible controller and steals the API token. The blast radius is **only what the token's permissions allow**. They can create or destroy VMs, but they **cannot** log into the hypervisor, they **cannot** alter storage, and they **cannot** compromise the host itself.

In any professional security model, limiting the blast radius is far more important. The Principle of Least Privilege is the foundation of modern infrastructure security.

## **So, is it truly more secure?**

**Yes, the API Token method is the correct and more secure choice for automation.**

You are trading a single, stronger authentication event for a massively reduced attack surface and a vastly smaller blast radius in the event of a compromise. This is the right trade-off to make 100% of the time in an automated system.

Your YubiKey is for protecting **your interactive, human access** as an administrator. The API token is for protecting **the automated, machine-to-machine access**. You are correctly using two different tools for two different jobs.
